# Documentation

   1. When POST a request is made to _/register_ (with username and password contained in the request), it saves the credentials to the database
   2. When POST a request is made to _/signin_ (with title and content contained in the request), it authenticates the credentials and returns a response with the status
   3. When POST a request is made to _/add_page_ (with title and content contained in the request), it saves it to the database
   4. When a GET request is made to _/retrieve_page_html_, it retrieves the webpage and displays it as raw HTML.
   5. When a  request is made to _/set_page_markdown_, we first do a GET request to /set_page_markdown which behind the scene           retrieves the requested url (internal or external url?, converts it to markdown and then send to the client for update.
      Now the client updates it and then sends a POST request to /set_page_markdown which converts back to html and stores.
   6. A GET request is made to /list_pages which retrieves all pages stored in the database.

### /retrieve_page_html
      The endpoint handles two methods

    * Converted to markdown
    * Sent back
    * User edits/updates page markdown
    * User sends POST request with updated markdown
    * Markdown is converted back to HTML and saved in the database
